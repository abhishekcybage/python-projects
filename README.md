## üìö Project Descriptions

### 1. Beginner Projects

These projects are designed for those who are just starting with Python. They include basic syntax, data types, and simple logic. Each project comes with its own README file that explains how to run it and what concepts it covers.

### 2. Calculator

This project is a simple command-line calculator. It can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user can input two numbers and choose an operation. The calculator then outputs the result.

### 3. Data Structures

In this section, you will find implementations of various data structures. This includes:

- **Lists**: Basic operations like adding, removing, and searching elements.
- **Stacks**: LIFO (Last In First Out) structure for managing data.
- **Queues**: FIFO (First In First Out) structure for handling tasks.

### 4. Football Stats

This project analyzes football statistics. It takes input data and displays various metrics, such as player performance, team standings, and match results. This is a great way to practice working with data and generating reports.

### 5. List Operations

Here, you will find functions that perform various operations on lists. This includes sorting, filtering, and mapping functions. These operations are essential for manipulating collections of data.

### 6. Loops and Conditions

This project contains examples that demonstrate the use of loops and conditional statements. You will find simple programs that utilize `for` and `while` loops, as well as `if` statements to control the flow of execution.

### 7. Set Operations

In this section, you will learn about sets in Python. The project covers basic operations like union, intersection, and difference. Sets are useful for managing unique collections of data.

### 8. Simple Programs

This category includes a variety of small programs that are fun to run. They cover different topics and are great for practicing Python skills.

### 9. User Input

This project showcases how to take user input and respond accordingly. You will find examples that ask users for information and provide output based on their responses.

## üìñ Usage

To use any of the projects, follow the instructions provided in each project's README file. Generally, you will need to:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the main Python file using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
